# Snake
Classic snake game represented with simple characters. The snake goes around a map collecting objects to increase score and grow in size. The game ends if the head runs into a wall or into it's own tail. 

This is my first attempt at recreating the classic game in C++. The code itself is split up into several header files and source files. 
The main .cpp file is contianed in the Snake.cpp file. The dimensions of the map can be easily changed by changing the values inside the
GlobalVar.h file. This project is still a work in progress and is still being optimized and bug tested.
